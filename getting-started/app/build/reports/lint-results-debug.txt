/home/astmin/Documents/Android/OpenCV/getting-started/app/build.gradle:15: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
  targetSdk 34
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:

/home/astmin/Documents/Android/OpenCV/getting-started/app/build.gradle:21: Warning: Missing x86 and x86_64 ABI support for ChromeOS [ChromeOsAbiSupport]
   abiFilters "arm64-v8a"
              ~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ChromeOsAbiSupport":
   To properly support ChromeOS, your Android application should have an x86
   and/or x86_64 binary as part of the build configuration. To fix the issue,
   ensure your files are properly optimized for ARM; the binary translator
   will then ensure compatibility with x86. Alternatively, add an abiSplit for
   x86 within your build.gradle file and create the required x86
   dependencies.

/home/astmin/Documents/Android/OpenCV/getting-started/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:5: Warning: Should explicitly set android:icon, there is no default [MissingApplicationIcon]
 <application 
  ~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "MissingApplicationIcon":
   You should set an icon for the application as whole because there is no
   default. This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource
   containing the image (for example @drawable/icon).
